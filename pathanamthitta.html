              <h3>Aranmula</h3>
              <h5>Aranmula, a UN heritage site, is famous for two things - the boat race and the Aranmula Parthasarathy Temple. Then, you can also buy an Aranmula Kannadi, an intricately-designed metal mirror made using a secret method that’s been passed down from over generations. It’s said to have a healing influence. Next, try and plan your trip during the Vallasadya, which is a huge 70-item feast celebrating the bravery and physical might of the oarsmen who participate in the boat festival. There’s always another story around the corner in Aranmula, making it one of the best places to visit in Pathanamthitta. If you want to get in on the snake boat race, it’s best to make your bookings in advance at one of the many heritage lodges available in the area. To book your stay, visit hotels.intermiles.com, and earn miles for every completed stay.</h5>

                <h3>Gavi</h3>
              <h5>Gavi is a carefully-protected natural reserve inhabited by some of the rarest and most elusive animals known to man. That’s why you have to be quiet, and carry your own litter when in Gavi. The local authorities, along with the villagers, go to great lengths to maintain this ecological vault of sorts. Gavi is a great place to go to trekking, but you have to be accompanied by forest officials wherever you go. The way the people treat Mother Nature will create deep respect for Gavi, making it one of the top tourist spots in Pathanamthitta.</h5>

              <h3>Konni Forest Reserve</h3>
              <h5>The Konni Forest reserves are a great place to spend a day with your family if you’re visiting Pathanamthitta, especially because it’s a very well-organised forest resort with excellent guides willing to take you around the place. If you can visit the elephant training centre where they break in wild elephants. Or, ride the bowl-shaped boats. Top tip- the bowl boats may get your head spinning, so better ride it on an empty stomach.</h5>

      <h1>Pathanamthitta</h1>
      <p>Pathanamthitta is one of the fastest-growing cities in India, and one of the first of its kind in the country to go completely cashless in 2017. As part of a government initiative to support e-wallets, the Pathanamthitta district collectorate office has rejected the use of cash 2017 onwards. This city is also considered the seat of Hindu mythology, since its home to the Sabarimala temple, which attracts millions of faithful devotees every year. To understand Pathanamthitta, you’d have to look within. And in case you’re wondering what to do once in the Land of Lord Ayyappa besides visiting the Sabarimala temple, here’s our list of the best places to visit in and around Pathanamthitta.</p>
